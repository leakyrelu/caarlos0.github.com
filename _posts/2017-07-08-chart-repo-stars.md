title: "Charting Repository Stars"
---

I always wanted to know how stargazers of my repos increased over time.
I didn't found a good way of doing that, so I wrote an app for that™.

The app stack is simple:

- go 1.8+
- glide
- gorilla/mux
- apex/log
- go-chart
- go-redis
- heroku

It is live at [starcharts.herokuapp.com](https://starcharts.herokuapp.com) and
the code is OpenSource at
[caarlos0/starcharts](https://github.com/caarlos0/starcharts).

The charts look like this one:

[GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser) stargazers over time.

Hope you guys enjoy it!
