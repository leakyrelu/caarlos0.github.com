title: "Measuring production code coverage with JaCoCo"
---

Microservices is the new fancy way of doing applications. Yet, most
companies still have big and old monoliths in production. In fast evolving
software of this size, it’s usual to have lines of code which are never
executed in production. Production code coverage reports can help
us find those lines.

The strategy described here can be used in virtually any Java software,
but what led me to do this was the difficulty to find code that was
not being used in a monolith.

## ContaAzul, the monolith

The monolith in question here is [ContaAzul][]. It started as a Struts2
application and evolved to a Java EE application, but still has Struts2
code running in it. You can check [these slides][slides] by [@Marcos][]
to get an idea on how it evolved.

According to `cloc`, it has ~5k Java files, summing ~400k lines of code.
That's a lot of code and I'm not even counting other kinds of source files
(like SQL, templates, etc).
In an attempt to remove useless Java code, I had the idea of running
the [JaCoCo][] agent in production server for a while to generate
the coverage reports.

## Wait, JaCoCo what?

[JaCoCo][] stands for "Java Code Coverage". It is usually used to
measure code covered by unit tests.

It is an agent that you pass to the `java` command in the
`javaagent` flag. It instruments the _bytecode_ and generates a binary
report file. Having the source and binary report files, you can generate
human readable HTML reports .

At the build phase, Maven plugins usually does all this work for us. But I
don't want the test coverage, I want production coverage. So, I need to add
the JaCoCo agent to a production server to instrument production code.

## Instrumenting production code

We don't use Maven in production, so I had to put the agent to run myself.

We use Puppet to manage our servers configuration. So, I wrote a manifest
that would download and instrument our Wildfly application server if a
`coverage` tag was set on the target node:

```puppet
$jacoco_version='0.7.9'

if tagged('coverage') {
  exec { 'download-jacoco':
    command => "/usr/bin/curl -L -o /storage/environment/jacoco-${jacoco_version}.zip https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jacoco/jacoco/${jacoco_version}/jacoco-${jacoco_version}.zip",
    creates => "/storage/environment/jacoco-${jacoco_version}.zip",
  }~>
  exec { 'unzip-jacoco':
    command     => "/usr/bin/unzip /storage/environment/jacoco-${jacoco_version}.zip -d /storage/environment/jacoco",
    refreshonly => true,
    creates     => '/storage/environment/jacoco',
  }
  file_line { 'jacoco_java_opts':
    path => '/storage/environment/contaazul/bin/standalone.conf',
    line => 'JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/storage/environment/jacoco/lib/jacocoagent.jar=destfile=/storage/environment/contaazul/jacoco.exec,output=file,append=true,dumponexit=true"',
  }
}
```

With that in place, I could tag the nodes that I want coverage reports for:

```puppet
node api {
  tag('coverage')
}
```

But running JaCoCo is only part of the problem. We also need to gather
the binary files and generate the HTML reports from them.

## Compiling the reports

The first step is to get the report from the server. The most
straightforward way to do that is to use `scp` and that was what I did.

```console
scp theserver:/storage/environment/contaazul/jacoco.exec .
```

Then, I downloaded and extracted JaCoCo to my `/tmp` folder:

```console
$ wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jacoco/jacoco/0.7.9/jacoco-0.7.9.zip -O /tmp/jacoco.zip
$ unzip /tmp/jacoco.zip -d /tmp/jacoco
```

With all that in place, I wrote a very simple Ant task to generate the
HTML reports:

```xml
<project name="ContaAzul" xmlns:jacoco="antlib:org.jacoco.ant">
    <taskdef uri="antlib:org.jacoco.ant" resource="org/jacoco/ant/antlib.xml">
        <classpath path="/tmp/jacoco/lib/jacocoant.jar"/>
    </taskdef>
    <jacoco:report>
        <executiondata>
            <file file="jacoco.exec"/>
        </executiondata>
        <structure name="ContaAzul">
            <classfiles>
                <dirset dir="." includes="**/target/classes"/>
            </classfiles>
            <sourcefiles encoding="UTF-8">
                <dirset dir="." includes="**/src/main/java"/>
            </sourcefiles>
        </structure>
        <html destdir="report"/>
    </jacoco:report>
</project>
```

Then, fire `ant` up and open the report in your web browser:

```console
$ ant
$ open report/index.html
```

You should see a report like this (this is a fake one):

ProTip™: if the Ant task fails, try to run it with `-v` for a more verbose
output.

## To automate, or not to automate

At this point I wanted to automate it all to get daily reports
(or something like that).

After giving it some thought, I decided that it wouldn't worth it.
The reasoning behind this decision was:

- JaCoCo may add some overhead;
- People won't look at these reports every day;
- Running it 24/7 would add this kind of complexity:
  - Merging reports;
  - Dealing with code that is always changing;
  - Ant failures due to class name conflicts (which may happen on big
multi-module projects).

I'm also aware that running it this way have its own setbacks:

- I (or someone else) have to manually generate and share the reports;
- Some code may be used only in some days or periods of the day (seasonality),
which may induce to humans removing code that is used.

Anyway, with all this code in place it's kind of easy to run it for a while
in a server and generate the reports later.

## Results

Having this coverage report is not a free pass to set on fire code
that shows up in it. It's more like an inspirational map of things that
we can remove. Using it as map, the team was able to open ~20
pull requests which removed ~5k lines of useless code in a very short time.

I'm happy with this result and looking forward to generate more
reports and remove even more code.

How about you? What are your strategies to find useless code to delete?
