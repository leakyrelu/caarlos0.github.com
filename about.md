A brewing data scientist and wannable hipster, Ankur hails from vibrant and fertile plains
of North India. Currently, he is a junior majoring in Computer Science at Wuhan University in China. 

When not writing code, Ankur is playing or watching game of cricket and drinking tea. He 
is your normal beer-and-skittles kind of lad and pretty easy to get along with and so
hippy that he implicilty praises himself while taking in thrid-person. 

Ankur is interested in everything Swift. He firmly believes that the best line of code you write is
the line of code you never have to write. He takes pride in writing scalable and clean code. So writing Swift-y 
and Pythonic code is his forte. Ankur also likes reading interesting ML/DL papers.
