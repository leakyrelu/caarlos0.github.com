A brewing data scientist and wannable hipster, Ankur hails from vibrant and fertile plains of river gangas
in North India. He is a junior majoring in Computer Science at Wuhan University in Mainland China. 

When not writing code, Ankur is playing or watching game of cricket and drinking tea. He 
is your normal beer-and-skittles kind of lad and pretty easy to get along with. He likes to implicitly 
praise himself in third person. He like travelling and exploring different cultures.

Ankur firmly believes that the best line of code you write is the line of code you never have to write. He takes pride in writing scalable and clean code. So writing Swift-y and Pythonic code is his forte. Ankur also likes reading interesting ML/DL papers.
